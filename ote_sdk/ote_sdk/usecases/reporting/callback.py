class Callback:
    """Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

    Properties
        params: dict. Training parameters
            (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
        model: instance of `keras.models.Model`.
            Reference of the model being trained.

    The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
    take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
    the current batch or epoch.

    Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Sequential` model class
    will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
    it passes to its callbacks:

        on_epoch_end: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
            optionally include `val_loss`
            (if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
            (if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
        on_batch_begin: logs include `size`,
            the number of samples in the current batch.
        on_batch_end: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
            (if accuracy monitoring is enabled).
