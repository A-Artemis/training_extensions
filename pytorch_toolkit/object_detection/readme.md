# Object detection

## Pre-trained models

This repo contains scripts and tutorials for object detection models training.

* [Face Detection](face-detection/readme.md) - models that are able to detect faces on given images.
* [Horizontal Text Detection](horizontal-text-detection/readme.md) - model that is able to detect more or less horizontal text with high speed.
* [Person Detection](person-detection/readme.md) - models that are able to detect persons on given images.
* [Vehicle Detection](vehicle-detection/readme.md) - models that are able to detect vehicles on given images.
* [Vehicle Person Bike Detection](vehicle-person-bike-detection/readme.md) - models that are able to detect 3 classes of objects: person, vehicle, non-vehicle (e.g. bike).

## Setup
